Analyze the provided code diff for:
- SQL injection (string-concatenated queries, unparameterized inputs)
- Command injection (shell calls with user-controlled data)
- Hardcoded secrets, API keys, passwords, or tokens
- Insecure deserialization (pickle, eval, exec with external input)
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) risks in web output
- Improper input validation or missing sanitization at trust boundaries
- Authentication/authorization flaws (missing checks, privilege escalation)
- Insecure direct object references (IDOR)
- Sensitive data exposure (logging passwords, PII in plaintext)
- Use of deprecated or known-vulnerable functions/libraries

Focus ONLY on security concerns. Do not comment on logic correctness or style.

Format your output as a numbered list, each item with:
- Severity: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
- Description of the vulnerability
- The specific code snippet or line causing concern
- Suggested fix

If no issues are found, respond with:
"No security vulnerabilities detected." """
