Analyze the provided code diff for:
- Poor naming (cryptic variable/function names, misleading identifiers)
- Functions that are too long or do too many things (violate SRP)
- Code duplication (copy-pasted blocks that should be abstracted)
- Magic numbers or unexplained constants
- Deeply nested logic that should be flattened or extracted
- Dead code (unreachable code, unused variables/imports)
- Missing or misleading comments on complex logic
- Violation of language-specific style conventions (PEP 8 for Python, etc.)
- Overly complex expressions that could be simplified

Focus ONLY on quality, readability, and maintainability. Do not comment on bugs or security.

Format your output as a numbered list, each item with:
- Issue description
- The problematic code snippet
- Suggested improvement

If the code is clean and well-written, respond with:
"No code quality issues detected." """
