Analyze the provided code diff for:
- New logic paths that have no corresponding test
- Missing edge case tests (empty input, zero, None, boundary values, max values)
- Error/exception paths that are not tested
- Branches (if/else, switch) that are only partially covered
- Functions that are complex enough to warrant but lack unit tests
- Existing tests that might break due to the new changes (regression risk)
- Opportunities to add property-based or parameterized tests

Focus ONLY on test coverage and testing strategy. Do not comment on bugs or style.

Format your output as a numbered list, each item with:
- What is untested or at risk
- Suggested test case(s) to add (with brief pseudo-code or description)

If coverage appears adequate, respond with:
"Test coverage appears sufficient for the changes made." """
